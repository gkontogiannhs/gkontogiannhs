- 👋 Hi there, I'm George Kontogiannis, and I'm a senior student of Computer Engineering and Informatics at the University of Patras.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my thesis which focus is on developing a conceptual information retrieval model that extends the classical Set-Based model by incorporating graph embeddings and machine learning techniques.
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing my knowledge in statistics, machine learning and other stuff. Love coding and doing interesting side projects. And always looking to improve coding skills.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning software development
- 📫 If you want to connect or chat about anything related to software development, feel free to reach out to me via email at [gekontog@hotmail.com](mailto:gekontog@hotmail.com) or through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-kontogiannis/) profile.
