- 👋 Hi there, I'm George Kontogiannis, and I'm a senior student of Computer Engineering and Informatics at the University of Patras.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my thesis which focus is on developing a conceptual information retrieval model that extends the classical Set-Based model by incorporating graph embeddings and machine learning techniques.
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing my knowledge in statistics, linear algebra and other stuff. Love coding and enjoy working on interesting side projects, while constantly striving to improve my coding skills.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on building an open-source ML software/library that can simplify complex machine learning tasks and empower developers to create intelligent applications with ease.
- 📫 If you want to connect or chat about anything related to software, feel free to reach out to me via email at [gekontog@hotmail.com](mailto:gekontog@hotmail.com) or through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-kontogiannis/) profile.
- 👀 Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! 🤖💻👨‍💻
