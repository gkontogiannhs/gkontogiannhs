- 👋 Hi there, I'm George Kontogiannis. I'm a PhD candidate in Generative AI and researcher at the IoT Laboratory of the University of Patras.
- 🔭 At the same time I'm extrapolating the findings of my Integrated Master's thesis. A scholarly paper is in the pipeline for submission to a journal.
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing my knowledge in DSP, linear algebra and other stuff. Love coding and enjoy working on interesting side projects, while constantly striving to improve my coding skills.
- 👯 I'd love to collaborate on building an open-source ML software/library that can simplify complex machine learning tasks and empower developers to create intelligent applications with ease.
- 📫 To connect or chat about all things software, you can reach me via email at [g.kontogiannis@upnet.gr](mailto:g.kontogiannis@upnet.gr) or through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-kontogiannis/) profile.
